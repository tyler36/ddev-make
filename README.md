## Overview

[GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a tool which controls the generation of executables and other non-source files of a program from the program's source files.

This add-on integrates build-essentials, which contain `make` into your [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) project.

See [Learn Makefile](https://makefiletutorial.com/).

## Installation

```shell
ddev add-on get tyler36/ddev-make
```

## Usage

This add-on provides a helper command:

```shell
ddev make
```

All flags and arguments are passed through to the command.

`ddev make` runs relative to the host working directory.
For example:

Given the following folder structure:

```
project
├── .ddev
└── tests
    └── Makefile
```

`cd tests && ddev make` will run correctly run the `tests/Makefile`.
